# RShiny_COVID-19


This R Shiny app was developed to visualize how the dynamics of COVID-19 state policies and various COVID-19 outcome measures are inter-related.
Specifically, COVID-19 outcome measures between 0 to 30 dayes from the onset of the COVID-19 state policies were compared.

COVID-19 outcome measures were referenced from IHME (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation of University of Washington), and COVID-19 state policies and their onset dates were referenced from healthdata.gov.
