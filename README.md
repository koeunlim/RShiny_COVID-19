# RShiny_COVID-19


This R Shiny app was developed to visualize how the dynamics of COVID-19 state policies and various COVID-19 outcome measures are inter-related.
Specifically, COVID-19 outcome measures between 0 to 30 dayes from the onset of the COVID-19 state policies were compared.

COVID-19 outcome measures were referenced from IHME (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation of University of Washington), and COVID-19 state policies and their onset dates were referenced from healthdata.gov.

Although more thorough statistical analysis is required to support the claims herein, this exploratory visualization provides insights to potential hypotheses that may be worth investigating.
Such hypotheses include:
  (1) Earlier COVID-19 policies (implemented in March~April) were driven by increasing new cases. These policies were effective in bringinging the rate (daily difference in the new case) below 0, slowing down the infection rate. The difference between the peaks of the new confirmed case rate and the new death rate was 5 days (death peak slower). 
  (2) Nonessential business (start) policy and Shelter in place (start) policy are interesting that Shelter in place's confirmed case rate starts dropping off faster than Nonessential business confirmed case rate, but the death rates for both policies start dropping at the same time. Both Nonessential business and Shelter in place started later in comparisons to other earlier policies due to the greater population that was impacted. 
  (3) Childcare (start)'s confirmed case rate is similar to Entertainment, Food and Drink, and Gym (start)' confirmed case rates. However, Childcare policy's death rate starts dropping faster than other three.
  (4)
